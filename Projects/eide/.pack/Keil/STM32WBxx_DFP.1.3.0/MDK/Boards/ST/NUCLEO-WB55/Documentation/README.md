# STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-WB55RG

## Overview

The NUCLEO-WB55RG is a multi-protocol wireless and ultra-low-power device embedding a powerful and ultra-low-power radio compliant with the BluetoothÂ® Low Energy (BLE) SIG specification v5.0 and with IEEE 802.15.4-2011. This Nucleo-64 is available as a standalone NUCLEO-WB55RG product but also integrated into the P-NUCLEO-WB55 product pack. The NUCLEO-WB55RG allows to simply and quickly evaluate STM32WB55xx and STM32WB35xx devices.
